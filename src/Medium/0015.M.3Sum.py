        # The problem is that you can't use a mutable object (e.g. list) as the key in a dict or set,
        # you need to use immutable such as strings, numbers and tuples. 
        # The ERROR is complaining because there's no built-in hash function for lists (by design), and 
        # dictionaries are implemented as hash tables. 
        #\Sets require their items to be hashable. Out of types predefined by Python only the immutable 
        # ones, such as strings, numbers, and tuples, are hashable. Mutable types, such as lists and dicts, 
        # are not hashable because a change of their contents would change the hash and break the lookup code.
        #\Below is from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19371358/python-typeerror-unhashable-type-list/19371472
        #\Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for 
        # different purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain an heterogeneous sequence of elements 
        # that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the 
        # case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed 
        # by iterating over the list.
        #\Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can 
        # be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain 
        # only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, 
        # it cannot be used as a key. You canâ€™t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index 
        # assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().

        # print(tmp)  # the result is: [(1, 2), (3, 2, 1, 2), (2, 1)], so the order of each element matters!
        # and each element is a tuple, not a list, how come my following lst_res is ok? Each element becomes a list?
